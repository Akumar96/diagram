# Diagram

## Build

```sh
$ npm run build
```

## Watch mode

```sh
$ npm start
```

## Development using sandbox

```sh
$ npm run sandbox
```

Sandbox is a development mode that allows you to review live changes while modifying diagram's code in a hot-reload fashion. Use with conjunction with `npm start`.
After running the command above, you can fool around with component's code in `/src/` directory and see immediate results in the browser after navigating to `http://localhost:8080`.
